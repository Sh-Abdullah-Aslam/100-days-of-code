# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## First ten days

### Day 1: September, 15 - 2020 (Calculator App)

**Today's Progress**: I designed and implemented a simple calculator completely from scratch (using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery). 

**Thoughts:** Today I refreshed my skills in Front-end Web development. I came to know that some browsers add whitespace between divs and to remove this I just shifted all these divs in a single line (no space left for whitespace, cool eh?  ðŸ˜œ).

This project was easy and helped me brush up on some previous skills including designing web pages using HTML and CSS and applying JavaScript functionality. Though in this project not much JavaScript was used, only jQuery.

### Day 2: September, 16 - 2020 (TO-DO-List App)

**Today's Progress**: I designed and implemented a TO-DO-List app.

**Thoughts:** Today I underestimated the challenge of designing and implementing a small TO-DO-List app. It turned out to be harder than expected and I learnt a couple of new things. 

Firstly, I learnt to add HTML dynamically into DOM. Then I learnt how to manipulate those elements on runtime. I learnt a new concept of delegates (I used it to trigger a function on dynamically introduced element, using its parent element).

### Day 2: September, 17 - 2020 (Digital and Analog clocks)

**Today's Progress**: I developed a digital and an analog clock.

**Thoughts:** Today I learnt CSS box-shadow, transition and translate (for rotation) properties. Along with this I used JavaScript `setInterval()` method to rotate the analog clock and change the numbers on the digital clock.

I preempted that task of animating the analog clock would be challenging, but it was not that difficult. I approached this problem by finding out the ratios between degrees and all three time units(hours, minutes and seconds) and multipling them with the current time units.
