# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 01 to 10

### Day 1: September, 15 - 2020 (Calculator App)

**Today's Progress**: I designed and implemented a simple calculator completely from scratch (using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery). 

**Thoughts:** Today I refreshed my skills in Front-end Web development. I came to know that some browsers add whitespace between divs and to remove this I just shifted all these divs in a single line (no space left for whitespace, cool eh?  ðŸ˜œ).

This project was easy and helped me brush up on some previous skills including designing web pages using HTML and CSS and applying JavaScript functionality. Though in this project not much JavaScript was used, only jQuery.

### Day 2: September, 16 - 2020 (TO-DO-List App)

**Today's Progress**: I designed and implemented a TO-DO-List app.

**Thoughts:** Today I underestimated the challenge of designing and implementing a small TO-DO-List app. It turned out to be harder than expected and I learnt a couple of new things. 

Firstly, I learnt to add HTML dynamically into DOM. Then I learnt how to manipulate those elements on runtime. I learnt a new concept of delegates (I used it to trigger a function on dynamically introduced element, using its parent element).

### Day 3: September, 17 - 2020 (Digital and Analog clocks)

**Today's Progress**: I developed a digital and an analog clock.

**Thoughts:** Today I learnt CSS box-shadow, transition and translate (for rotation) properties. Along with this I used JavaScript `setInterval()` method to rotate the analog clock and change the numbers on the digital clock.

I preempted that task of animating the analog clock would be challenging, but it was not that difficult. I approached this problem by finding out the ratios between degrees and all three time units(hours, minutes and seconds) and multipling them with the current time units.

### Day 4: September, 18 - 2020 (Tic-Tac-Toe game)

**Today's Progress**: I developed a tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** This project was easier than expected. I revisited the rules of variable naming today and learnt programmed a two-player game.

### Day 5: September, 19 - 2020 (Password generator).

**Today's Progress**: I developed a password generator.

**Thoughts:** Today I developed a password generator in which you can select rules and it will generate a random password. I used ASCII codes to generate characters and assigned them at different locations of the array(maintained as password).

### Day 6: September, 20 - 2020 (Data visualization in Python).

**Today's Progress**: Today I used python seaborn package for data visualization.

**Thoughts:** I completed the kaggle course on data visualization and downloaded a dataset from there. Applied different ways to visualize data. I found out that seaborn is imported as sns(Samuel Norman Seaborn) because these are the initials of a charcter played by Rob Lowe in The West Wing.

### Day 7: September, 21 - 2020 (Data visualization using Seaborn on Spotify dataset).

**Today's Progress**: Data visualization for Spotify dataset using different types of plots.

**Thoughts:** I used kaggle Spotify dataset to visualize the data for analysis. I applied data analysis on the same data and concluded inferences on the basis of different time intervals.

### Day 8: September, 22 - 2020 (NodeJS basics).

**Today's Progress**: Started a course on NodeJS on udemy.

**Thoughts:** Today I started a course on NodeJS. In the fist module I revisited the concepts of JavaScript ES6. Second module dived into NodeJS basics. It explained the event loop of NodeJs. Furthermore, I used Node to create a form that accepts data from user, saves it in a local file and re-routes the user back to the same page.

### Day 9: September, 23 - 2020 (ExpressJS basics).

**Today's Progress**: Continued with NodeJS course on udemy.

**Thoughts:** Today I learnt to install third-party-packages using node-package-manager. I used nodemon to incorporate the auto-restart functionality during development. I also used body-parser package. The most important thing I learnt today was the concept of middlewares in ExpressJS.

### Day 10: September, 24 - 2020 (ExpressJS basics).

**Today's Progress**: Continued with NodeJS course on udemy.

**Thoughts:** Today I continued with the NodeJS course got familiar with ExpressJS and converted NodeJS routes to ExpressJS routes. Learnt a convetion of naming a file

## Day 11 to 20


### Day 11: September, 25 - 2020 (ExpressJS continued basics).

**Today's Progress**: Continued with NodeJS course on udemy.

**Thoughts:** Today I continued with the NodeJS course for the third day. Learnt how to serve files with read access to the user.

### Day 12: September, 26 - 2020 (Templating engine - pug).

**Today's Progress**: Continued with NodeJS course on udemy.

**Thoughts:** I continued with NodeJS and ExpressJS. Although in a website we need to have dynamic content. I learnt to use pug templating engine along with ExpressJS.
