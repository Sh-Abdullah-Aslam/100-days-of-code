# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## First ten days

### Day 1: September, 15 - 2020 (Calculator App)

**Today's Progress**: I designed and implemented a simple calculator completely from scratch (using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery). 

**Thoughts:** Today I refreshed my skills in Front-end Web development. I came to know that some browsers add whitespace between divs and to remove this I just shifted all these divs in a single line (no space left for whitespace, cool eh?  ðŸ˜œ).

This project was easy and helped me brush up on some previous skills including designing web pages using HTML and CSS and applying JavaScript functionality. Though in this project not much JavaScript was used, only jQuery.
