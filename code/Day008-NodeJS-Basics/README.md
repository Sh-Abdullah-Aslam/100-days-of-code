# This is my eighth day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Technologies used
 * Node JS

## Thoughts
 Today I started a course NodeJS. The first module of this course brushed up my skills of JavaScript ES6. Second module dived into NodeJS basics. It explained the event loop of NodeJs. Furthermore I used node to create a form accept data from user, save it in a local file and re-route the user back to the same page.
