# This is my thirteenth day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Technologies used
 * Node JS
 * Express JS
 * Templating engine : handlebars

## Thoughts
 I continued with NodeJS and ExpressJS. Yesterday I used pug templating engine to render dynamic content. However today I used express-handlebars. My take of handlebars is that its not quite amusing than pug. It is embeded in HTML and applying conditional functionality is quite diffcult.
