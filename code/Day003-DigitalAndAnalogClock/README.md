# This is my third project (two projects technically) in the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Technologies used
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JavaScript (jQuery)

## Thoughts
 Today I developed two apps:
 * A digital clock
 * An analog clock
 
 I used CSS to design the clocks and used JavaScript to implement the logic of a working clock. I got familiar with CSS transform and transition properties. Moreover I used JavaScript set timeout event to apply the change of numbers in analog clock and to rotate the seconds hand in the digital clock.

 This project helped me brushup on Front-end Web development concepts.


## Here are some images of what I made
