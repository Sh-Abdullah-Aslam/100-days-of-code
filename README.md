# 100-days-of-code
 This is my repository for #100DaysOfCode challenge. I will update [log file](log.md) daily until I complete the challenge. 
 
 This was suggested to me by the lab where I am working as a Research Assistant since June 2019. Check out the lab at [Vision and Learning Research Lab](http://vision-learning.media-tics.net/).

## My latest project in this challenge was (Password Generator using JavaScript)

 Source code for this project can be found [here](code/Day005-PasswordGenerator/).
